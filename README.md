#### Requirements
1. .NET Core Version 5
2. OWASP ZAP https://www.zaproxy.org/download/
3. Docker 
4. Git https://git-scm.com/downloads
5. Linux Kernel https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package

#### Running and Building
##### Visual Studio
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/joshikaa/Exploit_MeV2.git using Visual Studio
2. Open the file in Visual Studio and run it

##### Docker
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/joshikaa/Exploit_MeV2.git
2. Go to the directory of the folder.    
2. Build the app <br />
   `docker build -t myapp .`
3. Run the web app for the first time <br />
   `docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name myapp myapp`
4. Stop the app to move the database file from the folder to the container <br />
   `docker stop myapp`
5. Go into the location of the database file <br />
   `cd Exploit_Me`
6. Copy the file over <br />
   `docker cp database.db myapp:/app/database.db`
7. Start the container <br />
   `docker start myapp`
8. Go to `localhost:8080` <br />
   Or<br />
   Type `ipconfig` into the command prompt to check for your IP address. The url would be `<your ipv4 address>:8080`

2.  Restart PC.

*** Known Issue
* Due to Docker containerizing our app, XML attack to read sensitive data in our database will not work, the challenge will still be counted as correct if you manage to put in the correct syntax. 
* Billion Laughs atatck in Docker cannot be tracked due to docker being a seperate entity from the Host machine.
